# Swahili wordnet python library

A library for using the SWahili Wordnet (also known as Swanet) - a lexico-semantic database of the Swahili laguage.

This library was created because swahili wordnet (devoloped using DebVisc 'xml file format') cannot directly be loaded from NLTK library and there was need of faster prototyping and viweing
of synsets in python as development continues. 

Currently the library support viweing of synonyms (visawe), hypernyms, hyponyms, Noun class (Ngeli) and getting root words.
